Overview



This project demonstrates the implementation of Linear Regression, one of the most fundamental supervised machine learning algorithms.

Linear Regression is used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data.

What is Linear Regression?



Linear Regression predicts a continuous output using the formula:



y=mx+c



Where:



y → predicted output



x → input feature



m → slope (coefficient)



c → intercept
