Logistic Regression Using Machine Learning

Project Overview



This project demonstrates the implementation of Logistic Regression, a supervised machine learning algorithm used for binary classification problems.

The notebook covers data preprocessing, model training, prediction, and evaluation using standard classification metrics.



This project is designed to clearly explain the end-to-end workflow of Logistic Regression for academic and practical understanding.

Model Used

Logistic Regression



Logistic Regression is a classification algorithm that predicts the probability of a data point belonging to a particular class using the sigmoid function.



It is widely used for:



Spam detection



Disease prediction



Fake news classification



Credit risk analysis



Feature Scaling



Feature scaling is applied using StandardScaler



Helps improve model performance and convergence



fit() is applied on training data



transform() is applied on test data to avoid data leakage



Model Evaluation



The model is evaluated using:



Accuracy Score



Confusion Matrix



Classification Report



These metrics help understand:



Correct predictions



False positives and false negatives



Overall model effectiveness
